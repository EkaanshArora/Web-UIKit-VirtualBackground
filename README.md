# Agora Web UIKit Virtual Background Demo

Use a Virtual Background for your video calls. This project is built with React and the [Agora Web UIKit](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Web-React-UIKit/).

## How To Use
Add your Agora App ID (and channel token) to `./src/App.tsx`.  
You can start the project by executing `npm i && npm start`.  

This is a good example to understand how to recompose the Web UIKit components to add a custom feature to your website built using the UIKit.
